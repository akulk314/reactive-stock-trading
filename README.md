# Reactive Stock Trading App

This app performs stock trades and is built using Spring's Reactor project. It is loosely based on Spring's reactive stock trading app sample project.

## Project Structure 

The app is made up of 3 microservices and a common libraries module. The folder structure is:

- common: Model classes shared by the microservices.

- orderservice: Allows users to place orders consisting of a ticker, a minPrice and a maxPrice.

- quoteservice: Generate quotes containing a ticker and a price

- tradeservice: Periodically fetch OPEN orders, and search for a quote whose price is in the 
                           order's price range. Fill the order if one is found, otherwise move it to the end 
                           of the Orders to be processed. EXPIRE orders that are past their expiry date.


Quotes and Orders can be optionally auto-generated by setting the **quoteservice.generator.persist** and the **orderservice.generator.persist**
flags to true in the **application.properties** file
